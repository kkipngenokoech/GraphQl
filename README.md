# GraphQl

GraphQL: APIs for humans

it is a query lanaguage and runtime for executing queries.

GraphQL represents data not in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; but in terms of a graph of objects and the models that are ultimately used in apps, like NSObjects or JSON

To get data from a GraphQL API, create queries from the frontend or client to get data from that particular endpoint.
