# GraphQl

GraphQL: APIs for humans

it is a query lanaguage and runtime for executing queries.

GraphQL represents data not in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; but in terms of a graph of objects and the models that are ultimately used in apps, like NSObjects or JSON

To get data from a GraphQL API, create queries from the frontend or client to get data from that particular endpoint.

## GraphQL API and Rest API and Django

we normally create serializers for django rest api

for GraphQL API however, we are going to create schemas.

To set up the schema, create a new file at the same folder where you have your settings.py file and name it schema.py
